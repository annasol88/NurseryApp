# Running the App

# Implementation Decisions

- inline styles for reusability and managable for the size of project
- folder structure

- not compatible for web becoz...
    - async storage
    - image upload 

- image upload is not efficient.
solution is hacky to be compatible on expo go ideally react native CLI will be used and configured with firebase as described:
